# Shapids---Shapes-Learning-Application-For-Kids

Shapids is a window-based application designed to enhance primary students' understanding of shapes. It provides an interactive platform for teachers and parents to teach and learn about different types of shapes. The application offers two levels of learning: Level 01 - Basic and Level 02 - Advanced.

Background
Before implementing Shapids, extensive research was conducted by gathering data on common users' opinions through an online questionnaire. The feedback and insights gathered from the users were taken into consideration during the design and development process of the application.

Features
Level 01 - Basic
The basic level of Shapids includes the following functionalities:

Learning basics of shapes
Drawing shapes
Changing scale, rotation, and color of shapes
Accessing various activities within the application
Level 02 - Advanced
The advanced level of Shapids builds upon the basic learning and includes the following modifications:

Finding shapes activities
Coloring shapes activities
Counting shapes activities
Technology Stack
Shapids has been implemented using the following technologies:

Java Swing: Used for front-end development, providing a user-friendly interface for the application.
OpenGL: Employed for 3D visualization, utilizing a cross-platform application programming interface for graphics.
Future Development: A 3D partition has been planned for the application and will be developed in the future.
Evaluation
To ensure a high-quality user experience, usability testing was conducted. This testing assessed the overall usability of the application by evaluating how easily users could complete a set of tasks necessary for typical usage. The feedback gathered from the usability testing helped refine the application and improve the user experience.

Goal
The primary goal of Shapids is to provide primary students with a comprehensive learning experience for a variety of shapes. By utilizing this application, both teachers and parents can effectively engage with their students in a stimulating learning environment.

By utilizing Shapids, we aim to create an interactive and engaging learning experience for primary students, enabling them to develop a strong foundation in shape recognition and manipulation. We hope that this application will prove to be a valuable resource for teachers and parents in fostering the educational growth of young learners.
